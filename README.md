# PROJECT4_ROSHAN - The Soul of India

## Introduction

The name ‚ÄúMai‚Äù means ‚ÄúMother‚Äù in the Marathi language ‚Äî spoken in the state of Maharashtra, a large and culturally rich region in western India. Maharashtra is renowned for its mouth-watering cuisine that delights the senses and nourishes the soul.

Mai‚Äôs Kitchen is a tribute to this culinary heritage, offering patrons an authentic taste of Maharashtrian flavors in a modern dining experience.

## Project Summary

This project is a Django-based restaurant reservation system built for "Mai's Kitchen".

- Design Philosophy
  - Built using the Agile methodology with iterative enhancements and user feedback
  - Designed with a responsive layout, optimized for both mobile and desktop users

- Project Overview
  - It follows Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture that enables customers to:
    - View homepage content and reviews.
    - Make table reservations online
    - View their upcoming reservations
    - Update or cancel their reservations as needed
    - Submit feedback. ( with and without login)
    - View contact info. ( embedded google map , email,contact number and timing)

  - It includes:
    - HTML templates for various pages.
    - Django models for Reservation and Feedback.
    - Forms to submit reservations and feedback.
    - Views for form handling, CRUD operations, and displaying data.

## MVT Architecture Breakdown

- Models 
  - Reservation: Stores reservation info, ensures rules (no past date, max 10 guests)
  - Feedback: Stores messages tied to reservation or user

- Views
  - PostList: Shows homepage
  - about_me: Saves or shows feedback
  - contact_us: Displays contact info
  - reservation_form: Save reservations after validation
  - update_reservation: Lets user edit their own reservations
  - delete_reservation: Confirm and delete a users own reservations
  - reservation_list: Display user‚Äôs rservations only

- Templates (HTML)
  - base.html: Master layout (header, footer)
  - index.html: Homepage
  - about.html: Feedback form
  - contact.html: Contact and map
  - reservation_form.html: reservation form
  - reservation_list.html: Display reservations made by the logged in  user
  - update_reservation.html: Edit form that helps logged in user update their own reservation
  - confirm_delete.html: Delete a users own reservations after login
  
- URLs 
  - /       ‚Üí Home (PostList)
  - /about/ ‚Üí Feedback (about_me)

## Features

- Core Feature  
  - Online Reservation System
    - Users can reserve a table with their name, email, date, time, guest count, and a message.
  - Form validations ensure:
    - No past dates allowed
    - Guest count must be between 1 and 10
    - Reservations are saved to the database and associated with the logged-in user if authenticated.

  - Update & Cancel Reservations
    - Logged-in users can:
      - Edit existing reservations (date, time, guests, etc.)
      - Cancel/delete reservations with confirmation prompts
      - Access to these views is protected with ***login_required*** for security.

  - Feedback Submission
    - Any visitor (guest or registered user) can leave feedback
    - Feedback is stored and shown on the ***‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page***
    - If logged in, the feedback is attributed to the user

  - Reservation List Dashboard
    - Logged-in users can view a personalized list of all their reservations
    - Reservation status (e.g., ‚ÄúRequested‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfirmed‚Äù) are clearly shown
    - Options to update or delete directly from the table

  - Contact & Location Page
    - Displays the restaurant's physical location using an embedded Google Map
    - Shows operating hours, email address, and phone number

  - User Authentication
    - Integrated with django-allauth to support:
      - Sign up
      - Sign-in/ Login
      - Logout
    - Protected views like ***‚Äúreservation list‚Äù, ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, and ‚Äúdelete‚Äù*** are restricted to logged-in users

- Responsive Data manipulations
    - Users see updated content after submission
    - No manual refresh is needed
    - Modal is used for reservation form on home page ‚Üí good UX design
  
  - **User Actions Receive Immediate Feedback**
    - All core actions (Create, Update, Delete) are:
      - Form-based, using ***POST*** methods
      - Backed with messages like:
        - messages.success(request, "Reservation submitted successfully!")
        - messages.error(request, "Reservation not found")
    - This provides real-time confirmation to the user.

  - **Views Render Updated Data Immediately**
    - After creating a reservation ‚Üí user is redirected to the reservation list with updated info.
    - After updating or deleting ‚Üí same pattern: redirect and update.
    - Feedback entries are immediately visible due to:
      - feedbacks = Feedback.objects.order_by('-created_on')
    - The latest data is shown right after submission.

- Security and Validation.
  - CSRF protection included in all forms.
  - ***login_required*** decorator,a built-in Django tool used to restrict access to certain views unless the user is authenticated, applied above function-based view (FBV)
  - Login required for updating, deleting, and viewing reservations.
  - Model-level validation to prevent past dates and excessive guests.
  - Feedback can be submitted anonymously or by logged-in users.

- ***DRY - ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù***, software development principle to minimize code duplication and centralize logic deployed
  - Reusable Forms with Django‚Äôs ModelForm
  
  - ***Template Inheritance*** - A single base.html file defines the common layout (header, footer, Bootstrap inclusion, etc.), which is extended by all other templates using ***extends base.html***
  
  - Reusable Views and Logic
    - Using ListView for the homepage (PostList) to list reservations.
    - Wrap views (ike update/delete) with ***login decorators***, reducing the need to write authentication checks manually.
    - Validate model rules (e.g., date/time restrictions, guest limits) using clean() in the Reservation model, so that the logic is reused automatically in all views and forms.
  
  - Centralized Validation Logic
    - All business rules (like ensuring the reservation isn‚Äôt in the past and guest limits are respected) are placed inside the clean() method of the Reservation model. This means whether data comes from the admin panel, the form, or a script ‚Äî the same validation applies universally.

- Mobile-Friendly & Responsive UI
  - Uses Bootstrap and Crispy Forms for:
    - Clean, responsive forms
    - Mobile-first design
    - Stylish layout with minimal effort
    - CSS media queries for different screen sizes.
- Admin Panel Integration
  - Reservations and feedback entries are accessible in Django‚Äôs admin interface
  - Admins can review, update, or moderate user submissions
- Footer Layout  
  - Social Media  
    - External links to Facebook, **X** (formerly twitter),Linkedin,Instagram, and Youtube pages in the website footer.
    - Each link configured to open in a new tab.
    - ***"Hover"*** property to hightlight social media icons.
  - Menu.
    - External link to download the menu in a PDF format.
- Others
  - Choice of foreground and background colors provide right contrast for a rich UI/UX experience .  
  - Aria accessibility for screen readers.
  - ***"Read More"*** buttons under "highlights section" of home page open in to external links.

    - Reservation Model: 
      - Stores name, email, date, time, guest count, and optional message. 
      - Includes: Validation to block past dates & Guest limits between 1 and 10
    - Feedback Model: 
    - Links to a reservation or user and stores feedback content

- forms.py (User Input)
  - Abstracts user input logic and applies consistent client-side + server-side validation.

  - Manages static/template settings for Heroku or local development
  - Configures CSRF trusted domains and login/logout redirects

## Features to implement later

- Use API to implement google map with markers- the js files are placed in a new app ***about**
- Implement through API Integration an external email system like sendemail to receive guest feedback.
the js files are placed in a new app ***about***

# Errors and Fixes


## HTML file creation 

- AttributeError ‚Äì Missing View Function
- Error: 
  - AttributeError: module 'reservation_app.views' has no attribute 'contact_us'
- Fix: 
  - The contact_us view function was missing or misnamed in views.py. 
  - Corrected the view function and ensured it matched the name in urls.py.


## Deployment Errors 

- Liquid Template Syntax: 
  - README.md processed by Jekyll for GitHub Pages includes Django/Jinja-style Liquid template syntax that GitHub Pages' Jekyll does not recognize.
- Solution: 
  - replaced or stylized all Django-style template tags using:
    - Triple asterisks (***...***) ‚Üí renders as bold-italic text
    - No raw blocks that would be processed by Jekyll
    - No unescaped or raw HTML that conflicts with Markdown rendering
    - All code-like syntax like in safe inline format

## HTML Code Validation 

- Issue :
  - Presence of Django templating does not pass the HTML validator at "https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea"

- Why it fails:
  - Django templates are not HTML by themselves ‚Äî they are pre-processed by Django before the browser ever sees the output. 
  - The validator only sees literal text, so ***block content*** is treated as a syntax error, because it is  not seen as valid HTML.
  - The validator only understands pure HTML ‚Äî not Django Template Language (DTL), Jinja, or other server-side syntax.

- How to validate correctly:
  - To validate HTML files used for this project:
    - Run Django project locally (e.g: with python manage.py runserver)
    - Open the page in browser (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
    - Right-click on the page ‚Üí "View Page Source"
    - Copy the fully-rendered HTML
    - Paste it into https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
    - This validates the actual HTML output, not the template.

# Code Validation

- Code was validated using CSS, HTML and Python Linters  
- gitpod IDE environment    https://bobrac3023-project4rosh-u31s29dj3zv.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net/
- Python Linter - https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com
